## Introduction

We wanted to take Flutter a step further and accelerate the process of building production-level apps. Presenting our solution- [Flutter Starter](https://flutter-starter.github.io/)!

Flutter Starter, as the name suggests, is a starter kit for Flutter that helps you bootstrap projects with all the essential modules like **State Management, API calls, Style Guide,** etc. It helps you build production ready apps in a jiffy. Handle everything at one place so you don't have to rewrite code.

## Motivation

Flutter gives us a simple counter app on installation which works if you are just starting out. However, while building a production-level app, we need state-management, API calls, Styleguide and common widgets. We frequently repeat this code in every project.

Flutter Starter is based on the **DRY principle. Don't Repeat Yourself** is a programming principle that is aimed at reducing repetition and redundancy. 

>:bulb: The **DRY principle** states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

Why is this useful? Applying the DRY principle helps code maintainability, improves development efficiency and much more!

## Features

* **Folder Structure:** Flutter Starter comes with a well-defined folder structure. Devs can easily navigate it and add files where necessary.

* **Style Guide:** This kit helps you to build a Style Guide for your app. You can add your image and font assets, splash screen, color constants and theme data. These are available for use wherever required in your project.

* **API Calls:** The starter kit includes all the files you need for API handling. You can choose from [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) depending on your project.

* **State Management:** Flutter Starter contains all the state management files, models and repositories for your app. We will use [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) for state management. 

* **Routers & Dependencies:** This kit allows you to quickly add routers for your app screens. Dependencies can also be added to your app by simply copy-pasting the install version from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) into the designated file.

* **Testing & Deployment:** Lastly, you can test and deploy your app smoothly using Flutter Starter! Go to the test folder, add your test files and start writing test cases. Check out the [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) or [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios) pages to deploy your app.

## Installing & Usage

Go toÂ [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)Â and install Flutter on your system. Proceed to ourÂ [Github repository](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/flutter-starter)Â and create a template.

To run the project, run:
```
bash run_script.sh
```

>:bulb: You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with our command-line tools. We use VS Code since it is lightweight.

## Examples

Here are some of the example apps made using Flutter Starter:
